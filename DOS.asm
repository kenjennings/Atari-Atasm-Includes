;; The binary load file has a segmented structure 
;; specifying starting address, and ending address, 
;; followed by the bytes to load in that memory range.  
;; DOS observes two special addresses when loading data.
;; If the contents of the INIT address changes ater loading
;; a segment DOS calls that address immediately. If the routine
;; returns to DOS cleanly then file loading continues.
;; If the contents of the RUN address changes DOS waits until
;; all segments from the file are loaded and then calls the RUN
;; address target.

DOS_RUN_ADDR =  $02e0 ;; Execute here when file loading completes.
DOS_INIT_ADDR = $02e2 ;; Execute here immediately then resume loading.
